TERASHIMA1 data set 
Description: 540 Irregular test instances 
Artificially created data set with convex polygons.
Procedure described by Terashima-Marín, 2010.


For each instance we report:
- first line: the number N of pieces;
- second line: the width and height of the rectangular objects where pieces are placed.
- each of next N lines: number of vertices and coordinates x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 ... xN yN.  
  Coordinates are counterclockwise.

For 510 instances, optimum is known and it is given.  
Optimum placing for <INSTANCE>.txt is in file Op<INSTANCE>.txt

For each file Op<INSTANCE>.txt we report:
- first line: the number of objects followed by how many pieces are in each object.
- second line: the width and height of the rectangular objects where pieces are placed.
- each of next N lines: number of vertices and coordinates x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 ... xN yN 
  where each piece is placed in the optimal solution.
